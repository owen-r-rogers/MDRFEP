# MDR-FEP
----
This contains all of the code and scripts that I used for my MA in chemistry thesis. I've included essentially every script that served some use to me at some point, and it's entirely possible that in the grand scheme of my thesis that purpose became null at a certain point.

## Pipeline

The first part of this is setting up the molecular dynamics (MD) run


### Miscellaneous

If I wanted to quantify how much time I spent on very specific tasks that ended up serving me no purpose, I would like in this area. This has code that I imagined would come in handy down the line, such as codes for specific types of figures, scripts and notebooks for different tools I never ended up using, etc. Storing them here is my hope that one day I'll have to go digging for them.
