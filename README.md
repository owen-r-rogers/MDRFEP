# MDR-FEP
----

This is the repository accompanying my Master of Arts thesis in Chemistry. The focus of my thesis was using molecular dynamics (MD) and the Rosetta software to predict the effects of mutations to computationally designed protein binders (Cao et al. March, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04654-9). We used a combination of MD, Rosetta, and free energy perturbation to quantify the binding effects of each mutation. This method, called MDR-FEP (Molecular Dynamics Rosetta Free Energy Perturbation) is first described by Wells. et al (February, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.26477).

## The standard pipeline for MDR-FEP is to first carry out equilibrium MD of the WT sequence.
This involves:
  I. Energy minimization
  II. Equilibration
  III. Production MD
  IV. PBC correction
  V. Extracting frames
  For BOTH the binder and the binder-target structures independently.

With this completed you have an ensemble of WT structures that you can feed to Rosetta for fixed-backbone sidechain repacking and scoring.

## Before carrying out the Rosetta repacking and scoring you need an idea of what mutations you need an idea of what mutations you want to carry out, and what distance you want to repack each residue within. 
5 Å is a conservative selection, as it repacks a little bit of the structure while being carried out quickly.

You need the following directory setup:

main/
|
|--- dimer/
      |--- input/    # contains all of the frame*.pdb files extracting from the MD run
      |--- resfiles/ # empty folder right now right now
|--- monomer/
      |--- input/
      |--- resfiles/

## Create Rosetta resfiles for each sequence position
We want to repack all residues within a certain distance of each residue being mutated, and we want to do this for the same residues over the entire Rosetta repacking process. Edge residues that move in and out of an arbitrary distance will only be repacked part of the time, so doing this step fixes which residues are being repacked.

for this, you need to specify what distance this is, and you need to specify which chain you want to mutate.
