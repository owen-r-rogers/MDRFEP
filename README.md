This is the repository accompanying my Master of Arts thesis in Chemistry. The focus of my thesis was using molecular dynamics (MD) and the Rosetta software to predict the effects of mutations to computationally designed protein binders (Cao et al. March, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04654-9). We used a combination of MD, Rosetta, and free energy perturbation to quantify the binding effects of each mutation. This method is first described by Wells. et al (February, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.26477).
