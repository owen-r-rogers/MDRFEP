This is the repository accompanying my Master of Arts thesis in Chemistry. The focus of my thesis was using molecular dynamics (MD) and the Rosetta software to predict the effects of mutations to computationally designed protein binders (Cao et al. March, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04654-9).
